# Michelle Wu's Personal Project

### About

This is an ongoing personal project that was created during my time at Dev Academy Aotearoa. My project allowed me to really solidfy my understanding of full stack web development + practice my CSS skills. 

One of my hobbies includes gaming - I am a big fan of Epic Games' `Fortnite Battle Royale` and my project is a reflection of that. 

My personal project utilises the following tech stack:
- React with webpack
- Redux 
- Knex
- SQlite 
- REST API

This project is a way to be able to view Fortnite's in-game store, news and current crew pack by pulling from external APIs.
The `current item shop` refreshes daily at 1pm NZT, and the `monthly crew pack` refreshes on the first of every month.

There is also a section to view my current in-game locker, and a form to be able to add new cosmetics whenever I make a purchase.
